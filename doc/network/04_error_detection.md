# Error Detection

## Functional design

We have selected an encryption technology, AES-GCM, which includes
error (or intentional misuse) detection, along with authenticatoin as
the sender and receiver must be coordinated in order to encrypt, decrypt,
and detect data errors.

See [3_encryption.md](./4_encryption) for additional details.
