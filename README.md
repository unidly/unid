# Unid - Integer server

Unid server provides integers that are unique and sequential.

The range of integers provided can be 16-bit, 32-bit, 64-bit and 128-bit.

It is helpful to think of a Unid as an Integer as a Service,  much like
Software As A Service (SaaS).

A series of sequential, unique integers can be purchased. A number of
guarantees are provided for the purchaser (see below).

Pricing
16-bit area unids are provided without charger. the free account provides integers
starting at 1 and ending at 65,536. After serving the 65,536 integers, the
free account is closed.

32-bit unids are charged as follows:
1 to 65,536  - no fee
1 million to 1 billion - 
1 billion to 4,294,967,296 unids -
After serving 1,294,967,296 unids, the account is closed, unless upgraded.

Total cost for entire 32-bit range of integers: $

64-bit unids are charged as follows:
1 to 65,536  - no fee
1 million to 1 billion - 
1 billion to 4,294,967,296 unids -
After serving 1,294,967,296 unids, the account is closed, unless upgraded.


128-bit unids are charged as follows:

## Identifieer

Unid builds on programming language and database native integer datatypes of
16, 32 and 64-bit. Unid also supports 128-bit integers that can be supported
in most computer languages and databases with straightforward extensions and
supported techniques.


## Purpose of Unid

The primary purpose of Unid is to provide an alternative for distributed
system application that require unique record identifiers. Unid integer
identifiers are guaranteed to be:

1. Unique
1. Sequential
1. Performant
1. Highly reliable
