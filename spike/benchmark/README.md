# Benchark

This directory contains application specific benchmarking software. The
main purpose is to get a feel for the library API, and to run some simple
benchmarks that can be used to compare one library against another.

These are simple programs, and are truly performance benchmarks of the
library, but do provide some insight into application performance.

Based on these benchmarks, we select libraries for use in the project.
